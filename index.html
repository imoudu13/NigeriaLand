            <p>
                Oko-Orisan Waterfront Land Scheme Website<br>
                <br>
                <h3>Genesis:</h3><br>
                Around year 2010, the Lagos State Gov’t (LASG) under Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN) initiated the Oko-Orisan Waterfront land Scheme in the Lekki/ Epe road axis of Lagos State. Members of this group individually purchased plot(s) of land in the scheme.<br>
                <br>
                We were all issued official  LASG receipts and original copies of allocation letters by the Land Bureau of the office of the LASG Governor.<br>
                <br>
                <h3>The Situation Today:</h3><br>
                The challenge, today, is that since our consummation of the contract with the LASG, we are yet to be physically allotted our plots in the scheme.<br>
                <br>
                We have severally visited the appropriate offices of the LASG in Alausa, Ikeja to inquire about progress, and the appropriate officials of the LASG have always confirmed that our documentations are genuine and valid.<br>
                <br>
                The official reason for the non-allotment is that since around 2013, the scheme had been suspended to allow for redesigning. However, unconfirmed reasons include:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attempt by LASG to abandon the scheme in order to re-allocate the now very juicy plots to wealthy and influential figures in society</li>
                    <li>Attempt by LASG to move subscribers to a different and “less attractive” schemes/location.</li>
                    <li>Attempt by LASG to mandate all subscribers to pay more money to make the total cost commensurate with current market rates.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Next steps:</h3><br>
                This group was birthed by the need for a strong platform to engage the LASG to fulfil its part of our contract by allotting us our due plots of land per the contract we entered into, and without any further delays.<br>
                <br>
                Actions Taken by The Group To Date<br>
                The group has corresponded with the LASG in the hope of triggering them into action. Unfortunately, the LASG’s response to the group failed to inspire any confidence or hope of any imminent action on the part of the LASG to resolve the impasse.<br>
                <br>
                The Group has also embarked on wide media campaign (see below web links) to put its dilemma in the court of public opinion. Yet, that does not seem to have achieved any impact with the LASG. <br>

                The Group is now weighing up other options available to it to help its members redeem their rightful entitlement from the LASG.<br>
                <br>
                To achieve this, the Group is seeking to enlist the membership of other affected members of the society.<br>
