            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                This site was created to unite Oko-Orisan Waterfront Land landowners. Join us as we work together 
                to for the rightful possession of our land. <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Genesis:</h3><br>
                Around year 2009, the Lagos State Government (LASG) led by Governor Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN), 
                launched the Oko-Orisan Waterfront land Scheme along the Lekki/ Epe road axis of the State. 
                Members of this group individually purchased plot(s) of land through this initiative, and each member was 
                issued with official LASG receipts and allocation letters by the Lands Bureau of the office of the Governor's office,
                authenticating our ownership.<br>
                <br>
                <h3>The Situation Today:</h3><br>
                Since our completing our contract with the Lagos State Government (LASG), we have not yet bene physically allotted our plots.<br>
                <br>
                The official reason given is that the scheme had been suspended since 2013 for redesigning. However, there are unconfirmed <br>
                that the LASG may be planning to re-allocate the now very juicy plots to influential individuals or move subscribers to 
                “less attractive” locations.
                We have formally requested the LASG to fulfil its part of our contract by allotting our plots. After expressing our concerns in writing,
                our representative met with the Legal Officer at the Lands Bureau, who informed our Rep. that the matter falls outside her purview. 
                She advised us to meet with the Executive Secretary, Lands.
                
                In response to our inquiries, the LASG through a letter dated April 2, 2024 (reference number LU/OWF/RES/18/89) confirmed that the 
                Orisan waterfront schme is being redesigned, and no allottees can take physical possession or process their respective Certificate of Occupancy until the redesign is complete. Please be assured that all allottees will be contacted as soon as the exercise is concluded.”
                        
                <h3>Next steps:</h3><br>
                This group was birthed by the need for a strong platform to engage the LASG to fulfil its part of our contract by allotting us our due plots of land per the contract we entered into, and without any further delays.<br>
                <br>
                Actions Taken by The Group To Date<br>
                The group has corresponded with the LASG in the hope of triggering them into action. Unfortunately, the LASG’s response to the group failed to inspire any confidence or hope of any imminent action on the part of the LASG to resolve the impasse.<br>
                <br>
                The Group has also embarked on wide media campaign (see below web links) to put its dilemma in the court of public opinion. Yet, that does not seem to have achieved any impact with the LASG. <br>

                The Group is now weighing up other options available to it to help its members redeem their rightful entitlement from the LASG.<br>
                <br>
                To achieve this, the Group is seeking to enlist the membership of other affected members of the society.<br>
